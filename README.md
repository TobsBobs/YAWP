Yet Another Weatherstation Pi

A weather station based on a Raspberry Pi.

This particular model has a 4x20 LCD character display and several DS1820 sensors attached. Maybe it will have barometric pressure and other sensors later. 

It uses [gnuplot](http://gnuplot.info) to generate a graph in .png that can be used on the website.

ToDo
----

- Add more sensors
