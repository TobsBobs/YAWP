Yet Another Weatherstation Pi

A weather station based on a Raspberry Pi.

This particular model has a 4x20 LCD character display and several DS1820 sensors attached. Maybe even barometric pressure and other sensors. It will also output some nice graphs via a webserver. The data is completed by Yahoo weather data.

ToDo
----

- Add more sensors
